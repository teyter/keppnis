# A Real Challenge
#
# Old MacDonald had a farm, and on that farm she had a 
# square-shaped pasture, and on that pasture she had a 
# cow that was prone to escape. So now Old MacDonald 
# wants to set up a fence around the pasture. Given 
# the area of the pasture, how long a fence does Old 
# MacDonald need to buy? 
#
# Input
# The input consists of a single integer a (1 <= a <= 10**18,
# the area in square meters of Old MacDonaldâ€™s pasture.
#
# Output 
# Output the total length of fence needed for 
# the pasture, in meters. The length should be 
# accurate to an absolute or relative error of at most 10**(-6)
#
# Sample Input 1    Sample Output 1
# 16                16
#
# Sample Input 2    Sample Output 2
# 5                 8.94427190999915878564

import math

# a = math.sqrt(int(input())) * 4
a = int(intput())
if a < 0 or a >= 10**18:
    a = math.sqrt(a) * 4
    print(a)
else: print("Please enter a number on this interval (1 <= a <= 10**18")
